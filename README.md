# astrometric
Code used to analyze astrometric errors in LSST images.

TO TEST USING IDL:  

idl
.compile astrometric.pro
astrometric

It will produce a plot of astrometric error as a function of separation.

These programs are designed to take in catalogs from 10 successive images of a star field generated by PhoSim (https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home).

To generate the images using PhoSim, run the shell file in /examples, called phosim.sh.  It assumes you are running phosim from the /examples directory.  

Astrometric.pro runs on SExtractor catalogs of the original FITS images.  Both are included in the /examples directory for testing.
